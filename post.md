# Census Academy Launches with 2 R Courses

The US Census Bureau recently launched [Census Academy](https://www.census.gov/academy), an online platform focused on training the public to learn about Census data. R Enthusiasts will be excited to learn that Census Academy has launched with two R-specific courses:

 * [Census Data in R](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/courses/ranking-project.html) by Jerzy Wieczorek
 * [Mapping Census Bureau Data in R with Choroplethr](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/courses/choroplethr.html) by Ari Lamstein

If you have an interest in using R to analyze US Census Data, then, in addition to the above courses, you might also want to read [A Guide to Working with Census Data in R](https://rconsortium.github.io/censusguide/). The Guide summarizes the most popular datasets that the Census Bureau publishes, as well as the most popular R packages for working with Census Data.

A Guide to Working with Census Data in R was created as part of the R Consortiumâ€™s Census Working Group, which you can learn more about [here](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2018/07/30/r-consortium-proposal-accepted/).
